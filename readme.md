# un**BLOCH**ed - Bloch sphere simulator

I created this website during my last year of the Master's degree in Quantum Engineering as a way to learn more on the topic and about web-developement.

The goal of the website is to give users a quick and easy way to "skecth" some ideas without needing to code, while allowing them as much flexibility as possible.

## Features

- [X] ‚úçÔ∏è**Latex input**: All values can be inserted in a user-friendly way using the usual LaTeX commands, with the benefit of smart recognition of the most common symbols. To type $\phi$ simply write `phi`, to insert a fraction, typing `\` is sufficient. (This wouldn't be possible without the amazing [https://mathlive.io/](mathlive.io) and the support of its creator).
- [X] üÜó**Custom matrices with validation**: Both the density matrix and the gate matrix can be fully customized and instant validation is performed to give the user a feedback of what they are typing. Example: if a gate matrix is not unitary, the user is warned and stopped from proceeding.
- [X] üåê**3D visualization**: The 3D view of the Bloch sphere reacts instantly to the changes done by the user and can be customized to show or hide different visual aids.
- [X] üñº**Image export**: You can export the 3D scene as a PNG image with a single click. (_Hamburger menu in the 3D scene_ $\rightarrow$ _Save Image_)
- [X] üïπ**Joystick mode**: No more frustating "3D" drawing of the Bloch spehre or animations using your arms to show what you mean! Now you can control the Bloch vector as in a video game using your mouse and/or keyboard.

- [ ] üì±**Mobile support**: Partial support for small screens and/or touch devices. There are still some bugs that need to be fixed but many features are already working!
- [ ] **Mixed states**: Partial support for mixed states is already present but I plan to expand this in the future, so stay tuned for an update! 

## Coming soon

I have a lot more features planned for the simulator and would be happy to hear what you think:

- [ ] ‚ùì**Tutorial**: A simple and easy to understand explanation for novice users and students to learn more about quantum computing and information.
- [ ] **Vector notation**: So far the only way to input a new state is to insert its density matrix, I would like to allow users to write something like $\Psi = \alpha |0 \rangle + \beta |1 \rangle$ to make it easier to experiment.
- [ ] **Time evolution**: I plan on adding a way to simulate the time evolution of the Bloch sphere according to some model (e.g. Bloch-Redfield). This would allow user to press "Play" to see how the Bloch vector would evolve as time passes.
- [ ] **Noise**: I would like to allow the implementation of some sort of noise on the state.
