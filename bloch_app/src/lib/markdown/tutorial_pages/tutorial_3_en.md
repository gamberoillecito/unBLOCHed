# Play with Quantum States
In this lecture we will understand which are some of the most important quantum states and how they are represented on the Bloch sphere.

Let's start from the one that we have already encountered: $\ket 0$ and $\ket 1$.
By clicking on the buttons you can see their representation on the Bloch's sphere:
- $\ket 0$ is represented as the north pole of the sphere.
- $\ket 1$ is identified with the south pole of the sphere

This states have an important property: If the qubit is in one of this two states the results are deterministic. This is simply because one of the two coefficient $\alpha$ and $\beta$ is zero, and the other is one. 
In other words, for the state $\ket 0$ we have that $\alpha = 1$ and $\beta = 0$. This means that a measure on such state gives $\ket 0$ with probability $|\alpha|^2 = 1$ and $\ket 1$ with probability $|\beta|^2 = 0$. 

Now, lets go on with the other states: $\ket + \ket - \ket{+i} \ket{-i}$.
The Dirac representation of this states is:

$$|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle + |1\rangle)$$

$$|-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle - |1\rangle)$$

$$|+i\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle + i|1\rangle)$$

$$|-i\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle - i|1\rangle)$$

Note that they are equal superposition of the basis states $\ket 0$ and $\ket 1$, meaning that the coefficients have the same modulus but different phases. 

Click on them to see their representation on the Bloch's Sphere!
You will discover that they are all points on the equator of the Bloch sphere. The fact that they all differ from a phase, results in the fact that you .
