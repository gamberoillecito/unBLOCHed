# What is a Qubit?

A qubit (short for quantum bit) is the basic unit of quantum information.
As classical bits are the minimal unit of information in classical computers, qubits have the same rule in quantum computers. In classical computers, there is very little you can do with a single bit (you can just flip it or leave it as is); with a single qubit, on the other hand, you can do much more and the goal of this website is to show you what this is.

While a classical bit has only two possible states (0 or 1), a quantum bit can be in a superposition of both states at the same time. In the context of quantum information, the two states are typically denoted as $\ket 0$ and $\ket 1$. This way of writing quantum states is called "[Dirac Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra%E2%80%93ket_notation$0)".  It is common to call $\ket 0$ and $\ket 1$ "basis states"

The meaning of the word "superposition" is easier to understand by looking at the mathematical definition of a quantum state.
Mathematically, a qubit's state is represented as:

$$
|\psi \rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle
$$

Where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex numbers that respect the so-called **normalization condition:** $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$. They are often called "**Probability amplitudes**"

An intuitive way of looking at this formula is that a quantum state $\ket\psi$ is a mixture of the two states $\ket 0$ and $\ket 1$ and the coefficients $\alpha$ and $\beta$ tell you the proportions in wich $\ket 0$ and $\ket 1$ are mixed.

In the chapter about quantum states we will see some interactive examples to better understand this concept.

Quantum bits can be encoded using different physical systems. Some examples are: photons, electrons and superconducting circuits.
