# Play with Quantum States

In this lecture we will understand which are some of the most important quantum states and how they are represented on the Bloch sphere.

Let's start from the one that we have already encountered: $\ket 0$ and $\ket 1$.
By clicking on the buttons you can see their representation on the Bloch's sphere:

- $\ket 0$ is represented as the **north pole**. <UpdateStateButton {DM} matrix={matrices.ket0} {canvasContainer} {history} disabled={false} secondaryButton={false}/>
- $\ket 1$ is represented as the **south pole**. <UpdateStateButton {DM} matrix={matrices.ket1} {canvasContainer} {history} disabled={false} secondaryButton={false}/>

  (Click on the buttons to visualize them.)

Now, lets go on with four other fundamental states: $\ket + \ket - \ket{+i} \ket{-i}$.
Their Dirac representation is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ket{+} &= \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0} + \ket{1})  &
\ket{+i} &= \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0} + i\ket{1})  \\
\ket{-} &= \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0} - \ket{1}) &
\ket{-i} &= \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0} - i\ket{1})
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that they are equal superposition of the basis states $\ket 0$ and $\ket 1$. This means that, going back to the previous lecture, $|\alpha|^2 = |\beta|^2 = 1/2$.

Click on them to see their representation on the Bloch's Sphere!

You will discover that Â that all four lie on the equator of the Bloch sphere.
